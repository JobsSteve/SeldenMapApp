SeldenMapApp
============

This is the code for an interactive map of China iOS application. 

About the Application
=====================

The Selden Map iPad App is an interactive exploration of an Chinese trading map from the Ming Dynasty. The map has been sitting in Oxford for over 400 years without much attention. In 2010, Dr. Robert Batchelor of Georgia Southern University discovered faint sea routes marked onto the map. This has sparked renewed interest in the map, and led to a restoration in 2011.

From 2012-2013 I worked on developing a prototype of this application in conjunction with Dr. Batchelor and Designer Foster Stilp (www.foster-douglas.com). 

A working demonstration of the app can be seen here: https://vimeo.com/68334138
