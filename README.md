============

The Selden Map App is an interactive educational app designed to teach users about ancient China. 

About the Application
=====================
##Background about the App
The Selden Map iPad App is an interactive exploration of an Chinese trading map from the Ming Dynasty. The map has been sitting in Oxford for over 400 years without much attention. In 2010, Dr. Robert Batchelor of Georgia Southern University discovered faint sea routes marked onto the map. This has sparked renewed interest in the map, and led to a restoration in 2011.

##Personal Contributions
From 2012-2013 I worked on designing and developing a prototype of this application in conjunction with Dr. Batchelor and Designer Foster Stilp. I implemented all the code in the prototype and have since stopped working on the app. The app was developed with XCode 4 for iPad's running iOs 6, and hasn't been extensively tested since the release of iOs 7.
